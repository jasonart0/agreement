        <h3 class="contract-title text-start">DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS CONCERNING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>The Employee agrees that a material term of the Employee's contract with the Employer is to keep all Confidential Information absolutely confidential and protect its release from the public. The Employee agrees not to divulge, reveal, report or use, for any purpose, any of the Confidential Information which the Employee has obtained or which was disclosed to the Employee by the Employer as a result of the Employee's employment by the Employer. The Employee agrees that if there is any question as to such disclosure then the Employee will seek out senior management of the Employer prior to making any disclosure of the Employer's information that may be covered by this Agreement.</p>
        <p>The Employee agrees and acknowledges that the Confidential Information is of a proprietary and
            confidential nature and that any disclosure of the Confidential Information to a third party in
            breach of this Agreement cannot be reasonably or adequately compensated for in money damages, would cause irreparable injury to Employer, would gravely affect the effective and
            successful conduct of the Employer's business and goodwill, and would be a material breach of
            this Agreement.</p>
